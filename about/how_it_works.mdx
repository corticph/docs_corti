description: 'Understanding interactions and facts'
---

An **Interaction** is the fundamental unit within the Corti API that encapsulates the entire conversation or session between a medical professional and a patient. It ties together all related data and operations, enabling a cohesive workflow from the start of the interaction to the generation of final documentation.

Within an interaction, the Corti API extracts **Facts**, atomic pieces of information that are critical for documenting an interaction accurately. These facts can include details such as the patientâ€™s name, height, blood pressure, symptoms, and other clinically relevant data. Facts are designed to help clinicians quickly identify the salient points of an interaction, making it easier to draft complete and truthful clinical documents.

## Key features of facts

- **Relevance and Precision**: Facts are distilled from the conversation in real-time, ensuring that every crucial piece of information is captured as the interaction unfolds.
- **Customizability**: Clinicians can easily add, remove, or modify facts to ensure that the documentation reflects the true nature of the interaction.
- **Integration with Documentation**: These facts form the building blocks of clinical documents, ensuring that every relevant detail is included without overwhelming the clinician with unnecessary information.

## Key API capabilities 

The available API endpoints leverage the foundational models offered by Corti for conversational speech-to-text, dictation, live note taking, summary document generation and evaluation, contextual search, knowledge retrieval from authoritative public references or your custom sources, medical coding and more. Where applicable, an alignment model can link evidence from inputs to model outputs to add guardrails and explainability. 

## Why choose the Corti API?

- **Purpose-built for healthcare**: Optimized for the unique needs and compliance standards of the medical field.
- **Seamless workflow integration**: Designed to work across multiple interaction points in clinical and operational workflows.
- **High accuracy and real-time processing**: Enables AI-driven insights to support healthcare professionals instantly.
- **Customizable and scalable**: Adaptable capabilities to fit your organizational needs.

## Bringing it all together

Through the structured flow of **Interactions** and the extraction of **Facts**, the Corti API delivers a cohesive and efficient experience, ensuring that all data, from live transcriptions to finalized documents, is tightly integrated and easily accessible. This interaction-centric approach, combined with the granularity of facts, makes it simple for developers to build robust medical applications that leverage real-time AI capabilities across multiple aspects of the clinician-patient relationship.

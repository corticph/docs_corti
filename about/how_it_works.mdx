title: How it works
description: 'Understanding Corti API endpoints'
---

The available API endpoints leverage the foundational models offered by Corti for conversational speech-to-text, font-end dictation, live Fact generation, document generation, ICD-10/CPT code prediction, contextual chat, knowledge retrieval from authoritative public references or your custom sources, and more. This page will provide an overview of each endpoint listed in the API Reference. 

## Why choose the Corti API?

- **Purpose-built for healthcare**: Optimized for the unique needs and compliance standards of the medical field.
- **Real-time processing**: Live data streaming with highly accurate fact generation enables instantaneous AI-driven support to integrated applications and healthcare professionals.
- **Seamless workflow integration**: Designed to work across multiple modalities within clinical and operational workflows.
- **Customizable and scalable**: Robust and adaptable capabilities to fit your organizational needs.

## Bringing it all together 

Through the structured flow of **Interactions** with **real-time** extraction of **Facts** during audio **streams**, the Corti API delivers a cohesive and comprehensive experience. Corti API ensures that all data, from live conversations to finalized documents and medical codes, are tightly integrated and easily accessible. 

This interaction-centric approach, combined with the granularity and flexibility of the endpoints, makes it simple for developers to build robust medical applications that leverage real-time AI capabilities across multiple aspects of the clinician-patient relationship and needs of the health system. 

## API endpoints 

### Available today 

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Interactions">
An **Interaction** is the fundamental unit within the Corti API that encapsulates the entire conversation or session between a medical professional and a patient. It ties together all related data and operations, enabling a cohesive workflow from the start of the interaction to the generation of final documentation. The Interaction endpoint allows you to discover all interactions available for your organization, create a new interaction, and update existing ones. When creating an interaction you'll receive an InteractionId as well as a Web Socket URL that can be used for real-time, streaming workflows. 
</Accordion> 

<Accordion title="Recordings">
The recordings endpoint in the Corti API allows clients to manage audio recordings associated with interactions. It is part of a larger workflow that includes initializing interactions, uploading recordings, generating transcripts, and creating documents based on the interaction data.
        
As an example, after initializing an interaction, clients can upload an audio file by sending a `POST` request to `/interactions/:interactionId/recording/`. The API responds with a 200 status code and returns a `recordingId`, confirming that the audio file has been successfully uploaded and linked to the specific interaction. Use the 'recordingId' in your next step, such as generating transcripts or documents. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transcripts">
The transcripts endpoint in the Corti API is part of the workflow for processing recorded interactions. After uploading an audio recording, clients can initiate the transcription process by sending a POST request to `/interactions/:interactionId/transcripts/`. The API then processes the audio and returns a 200 status code along with the generated transcript. This transcript contains the text version of the recorded interaction, extracted and formatted for review. The transcripts endpoint plays a crucial role in converting speech to text for clinical conversations and dictations, enabling further processing and documentation creation based on the interaction data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transcribe">
The transcribe endpoint enables stateless speech-to-text that can be used to power dictation workflows. Spoken or automated punctuation is supported, and commands can be defined in configuration requests. 

- See the [languages](/about/languages/) page for more information on how and which languages are supported. 
- See the [dictation SDK](/get_started/dictation-sdk/) page for a packaged SDK ready to integrate into your app within minutes. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Streams">
The streams endpoint enables **real-time** conversational transcript and fact generation. Designed for scenarios requiring immediate processing and feedback during live interactions, the streams endpoint operates over a WebSocket connection after initializing an interaction. Once connected, the client streams audio packets to the API, which responds with live transcripts and fact updates in real-time. 

This continuous data flow allows for instantaneous capture and processing of information, making it ideal for situations where immediate action is crucial. The stream can be updated with new facts during the interaction, and it concludes when the client sends an "end" message, formally closing the live session.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Facts">
Within a real-time streaming interaction, the Corti API extracts **Facts**: atomic pieces of information that are critical for documenting an interaction accurately. These facts can include details such as the patientâ€™s name, height, blood pressure, symptoms, and other clinically relevant data. Facts are designed to help clinicians quickly identify the salient points of an interaction, making it easier to draft complete and truthful clinical documents.

_Key features of Facts_:
- **Relevance and Precision**: Facts are distilled from the conversation in real-time, ensuring that every crucial piece of information is captured as the interaction unfolds.
- **Customizability**: Clinicians can easily add, remove, or modify facts to ensure that the documentation reflects the true nature of the interaction.
- **Integration with Documentation**: These facts form the building blocks of clinical documents, ensuring that every relevant detail is included without overwhelming the clinician with unnecessary information.
</Accordion> 

<Accordion title="Documents">
The documents endpoint in the Corti API is an essential part of the workflow for processing recorded interactions. After initializing an interaction, uploading a recording, and generating a transcript, clients can create the necessary documentation by sending a POST request to `/interactions/:interactionId/documents/`. This request utilizes generated transcripts and a templateKey defined in the request to specify the desired format of the output document. Upon processing the request, the API returns a 200 status code along with the final document. 

This endpoint allows for the generation of documentation tailored to specific needs, such as clinical notes or referral letters, based on the interaction data and predefined templates. The endpoint can be called multiple times for a given interaction if multiple document outputs are desired. See more details in the [Templates & Documents](/get_started/templates/) page. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Templates">
Templates in the Corti API allow users to specify the output of medical documents generated from various inputs, such as transcripts, facts, or other medical documents. They enable the definition of specific sections, structure, language, and writing style for documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity in medical reporting. 
        
For more information on how to find and use existing templates, how to build templates dynamically in the document generation request, or how to request a custom template, please see more details in the [Templates & Documents](/get_started/templates/) page. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Codes">
The codes endpoint in the Corti API provides access to code prediction models, which includes support for ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes as well as CPT code with modifiers. The API provides the ability to generate codes for a text that is defined in the request or documents associated with the interaction. 

Currently, the coding endpoint is available for use on a per-customer basis: customer-specific tuning is required so that coding output is tuned for client note styles and requirements. Check back soon for a general use coding model to be available.

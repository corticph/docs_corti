## Introduction
Corti foundation models are specifically designed for use in the healthcare domain. While automated speech recognition (ASR) capabilities are continuously refined, a tier system has been introduced to categorize functionality and performance that is available. Selecting language models at the appropriate tier allows you to find the right fit for your needs while balancing capabilities and cost. 

The language codes are also used for defining output language in note generation requests.

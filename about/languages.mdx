## Introduction
Corti foundation models are specifically designed for use in the healthcare domain. While the speech recognition models are continuously refined, a tier system has been introduced to relay functionality and performance that is available. Selecting language models at the appropriate tier allow you to find the right fit for your needs while balancing capabilities and cost.

## Introduction
Corti automated speech recognition (ASR) is specifically designed for use in the healthcare domain. A tier system has been introduced to categorize functionality and performance that is available per language and endpoint. Selecting language models at the appropriate tier allows you to find the right fit for your needs while balancing capabilities and cost. 

<Tip>The `language codes` listed below are used in API requests for both defining speech recognition language and document generation output language</Tip>

## Corti ASR language tiers 

| Tier           | Description | Primary use case |
| :------------- | :---------- | :--- |
| **Base**       | Enable speech-to-text with a **general medicine model** for various speech-enabled workflows | Automated speech recognition |
| **Enhanced**   | Base functionality plus **optimized medical terminology recognition** for a variety of specialties, balancing speed, performance, and quality | Ambient documentation workflows |
| **Premier**    | Enhanced functionality plus the highest accuracy, **lowest latency and most features** (e.g., customized commands, spoken or automated punctuation, and smart formatting) | Robust dictation workflows |

The medical domain is rich in complex language and specialized knowledge. As a result, to effectively support healthcare professionals with artificial intelligence (AI), it must be purpose-built for their needs. Healthcare AI solutions can improve patient outcomes and operational workflows by driving electronic health record (EHR) efficiency, summarizing vast medical research, unlocking knowledge bases, and surfacing critical insights to the right person at the right time. 

Since 2016 Corti has been researching and developing such opportunities to deliver the AI healthcare deserves. An AI platform built specifically for healthcare, respecting healthcare's complexities while steadily improving outcomes and experiences for both patients and clinicians, that can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems and workflows. 

## Corti Foundation Models

Corti offers three high-performing Foundation Models, each purpose-built to meet the rigorous demands of the healthcare sector:
- **Solo**: A fast model optimized for audio reasoning, enabling dictation, transcription, and conversation diarization.
- **Ensemble**: A robust model designed for automating documentation, reducing administrative burden.
- **Symphony**: A premium model that combines power and speed to deliver unparalleled performance. 

To further tailor AI-powered solutions, customer-specific tuning is available to enhance each Foundation Model with localized expertise. 

The opportunity to leverage the combined power, flexibility, and adaptability of these AI models will unlock new agents and workflows for addressing a myriad of healthcare challenges. 

## Integrate Seamlessly with Corti API

Corti Foundation Models can be integrated via the Corti API, allowing organizations to build bespoke AI solutions that meet their specific needs. The same API powers [Corti Assistant](https://assistant.corti.ai/) - a fully packaged, EHR agnostic ambient AI scribe that automates documentation, information lookup, medical coding and more. If, however, you want to embed Corti AI into your workflow or customize the interactions, then take a deeper dive into the API documentation. 

## Bringing it all together 

This documentation site outlines how to use the API and provides example workflows. 
- The [API Console](/get_started/getaccess/) to create an account and create client credentials so you can begin your journey. 
- The [Quickstart](/get_started/quickstart/) page provides an overview of how to work with Corti API. 
- The [API Reference](/api-reference/) page provides detailed documentation for each available endpoint. 
- The [Updates](/release-notes/) page provides release notes and other useful resources.

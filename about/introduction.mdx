The medical domain is rich in complex language and specialized knowledge. As a result, to effectively support healthcare professionals with artificial intelligence (AI), it must be purpose-built for their needs. Healthcare AI solutions can improve patient outcomes and operational workflows by driving electronic health record (EHR) efficiency, summarizing vast medical research, unlocking knowledge bases, and surfacing critical insights to the right person at the right time. 

Since 2016 Corti has been researching and developing such opportunities to deliver the AI healthcare deserves. An AI platform built specifically for healthcare, respecting healthcare's complexities while steadily improving outcomes and experiences for both patients and clinicians, that can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems and workflows. 

## Corti Foundation and Expert Models

Corti offers three high-performing Foundation Models, each purpose-built to meet the rigorous demands of the healthcare sector:
- **Solo**: A fast model optimized for audio reasoning, enabling real-time insights from conversations.
- **Ensemble**: A robust model designed for automating documentation, reducing administrative burden.
- **Symphony**: A premium model that combines power and speed to deliver unparalleled performance. 

To further tailor AI-powered solutions, a suite of Expert Agents are available to enhance and customize each Foundation Model. These agents leverage advanced AI capabilities to address specific healthcare challenges, providing flexibility and adaptability for different use cases.

## Integrate Seamlessly with Corti API

Corti Foundation Models and Expert Agents can be integrated via Corti APIs, allowing organizations to build bespoke AI solutions that meet their specific needs. The same APIs power [Corti Assistant](https://assistant.corti.ai/) - a fully packaged, EHR agnostic, real-time ambient AI scribe that automates documentation, information lookup, medical coding and more. If, however, you want to embed Corti AI into your workflow or customize the interactions, then take a deeper dive into the API documentation. 

This documentation site outlines how to use the APIs and example workflows. The API Reference page provides detailed documentation for each available endpoint. If you have any questions about how to implement Corti AI in your healthcare environment, then [contact us](https://www.corti.ai/contact-us) to get started or for more information.

## Overview 
Corti provides a library of standard, out of the box templates for use in note generation workflows. Standard templates are comprised of standardized note sections that are also available for use. The default template library is always growing. 

### Requesting a New Template

Custom templates can be added upon request. To request a new template, follow these steps:

1. **Visit** the [Corti Help Center](https://help.corti.ai).
2. **Use the Chat Feature** to contact our support team.
3. **Follow the Prompts** to request a new documentation template.
4. **Name** the template to be created and provide a **description** of how it will be used (what type of information should be documented? Is this for a specific specialty or type of care?) 
5. **Provide Details**: Include any specific formatting, language, or structural preferences required for the note output.
6. **Select sections to be included**: [Click here](/templates/templates-standard#standard-out-of-the-box-sections) to see a list of pre-defined sections that are available for use in new template requests. If you require a section that is _not listed_ in the table, then please explain the new section required in the comments of your request so the Corti team can evaluate if the request can be fulfilled.

<Note>
  Notes: 
  - Our team will process your request and provide updates on its status. 
  - Custom templates can be provisioned so they are available for your organization only. 
  - Renaming a currently supported section requires a new template request. 
  - Request for new sections subject to Corti review and approval. 
  - Currently, there is no support for uploading existing documents for automatic parsing and template creation.

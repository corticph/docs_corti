---

In the Corti API, Templates define the structure for document that are generated by Corti Ensemble and Corti Symphony foundation models from various inputs, such as conversational transcripts, facts, or other medical documents. 

Templates are available in different languages and can be specific to your organization. Each template includes sections that set the structure (e.g., SOAP Note template consists of the four sections Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan), and a writing style and documentation format is defined for each section. This ensures consistency, clarity, and control in use of AI to support medical reporting.

## Key Features of Templates

1. **One Interaction, Multiple Documents**: Generate multiple types of documentation for a single interaction, e.g., SOAP note and Patient Summary.
2. **Customizable Formats**: Use templates tailored for various medical specialties, enabling the generation of various types of clinical notes, letters, discharge summaries, and your unique use case needs.
3. **Flexible Workflows**: Use pre-defined templates or cater to more dynamic workflows by selecting the desired, relevant sections.
4. **Template Management**: The API lets you retrieve and review a list of available pre-configured templates and the languages those are available in. Use the query filter for organization `?org` to only retrieve templates provided to you.


## Retrieving Available Templates

To generate a document, you must use a valid `templateKey`, and the template must be available in the required `outputLanguage`. You can retrieve a list of available templates and their language translations using the `GET /templates` endpoint. Depending on your use case, this may include either Cortiâ€™s standard templates or organization-specific custom templates.

**Retrieving Standard Templates**
Standard templates are accessible by default and can be retrieved without any query parameters.

```bash request to retrieve standard templates
GET https://api.{environment}.corti.app/v2/templates/
```

**Retrieving Custom Templates for an Organization**
If your organization has requested and been provided with custom templates, you can retrieve them by including your assigned organization identifier using the org query parameter. Be sure to use the exact organization value provided by the Corti Support team.

```bash retrieve templates by example org
GET https://api.{environment}.corti.app/v2/templates/?org=TestHealth
```

Custom templates are typically tailored to your workflows or documentation standards. If you're unsure which templates are available or want to verify the correct `templateKey` and language support, querying by organization ensures you retrieve the full list of templates assigned to your organization.

However, if Corti Support has already provided you with the relevant `templateKey` and language information, you can use those details directly without needing to query the endpoint.

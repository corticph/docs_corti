### Overview

Templates in the Corti API allow users to specify the output of medical
documents generated from various inputs, such as transcripts or other medical
documents. They enable the definition of specific sections, structures,
languages, and writing styles for documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity
in medical reporting.

### Key Features of Templates

1. **Flexible Template Selection**: Work with multiple templates to accommodate
   different documentation needs.
2. **Customizable Formats**: Templates can be tailored for various medical
   specialties, enabling the generation of clinical notes, referral letters,
   discharge summaries, and more.
3. **Seamless Integration**: The Templates API works in conjunction with the
   Documents API to automate the creation of structured medical documentation.
4. **Template Management**: Users can retrieve and review a list of available
   pre-configured templates via the Templates API. Each template is assigned a
   unique templateKey, which is required to generate documents. The API ensures
   access control by allowing users to view only the templates assigned to them.
5. **Automated Document Generation**: By specifying a templateKey, users can
   generate well-structured documents with predefined formatting and language
   consistency.

### Requesting a New Template

To request a new template, follow these steps:

1. **Visit** the [Corti Help Center](https://help.corti.ai).
2. **Use the Chat Feature** to contact our support team.
3. **Follow the Prompts** to request a new documentation template.
4. **Provide Details**: Include any specific formatting, language, or structural
   preferences required for the template.
5. Our team will process your request and provide updates on its status.

### Retrieving Available Templates

Before generating a document, users must retrieve a list of available templates
to identify the appropriate `templateKey`. Use a `GET /templates` request to
fetch all templates assigned to your organization.

### Using Templates to Generate Documents

       Client->>Client: Makes final edits to facts
       Client->>Public API: POST /documents with final facts list and templateKey
       Public API-->>Client: Return document

       Client ->> Public API: PATCH /interactions/:interactionId "completed"
       Public API -->> Client: 200, interaction
    ```

### Steps to Generate a Document

1. **Review and Finalize Data**: After the live session, the client can review
   and make final edits to the facts collected during the interaction. These
   finalized facts will be used to generate the document.
2. **Make a POST Request**: Send a `POST` request to the
   `/interactions/:interactionId/documents` endpoint with the finalized facts
   and the `templateKey` in the request payload. The templateKey defines the
   format of the output document.
3. **Process the Request**: The API processes the submitted data, applying the
   specified template to generate the structured document.
4. **Retrieve the Document**: If the request is successful, the API returns a
   `200 OK` status along with the formatted document.
5. **Mark Interaction as Completed**: Once the document is generated, the client
   should update the interactionâ€™s status by sending a `PATCH` request to
   `/interactions/:interactionId`, setting the interaction state to
   `"completed"`.

### Overview

Templates in the Corti API specify the output of structured, medical documents
generated by Corti's foundational model from various inputs, such as transcripts,
facts or other medical documents.
Templates are available in different languages and can be specific to your organization.
They are complemented by related sections that set the structure e.g. SOAP consists of the four
sections Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan; and for each section a specified writing styles
and formatting for documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity in medical reporting.

### Key Features of Templates

1. **One Interaction, Multiple Documents**: Generate multiple types of documentation,
   e.g. the clinical note and a referral letter, centered around the same interaction.
2. **Customizable Formats**: Use templates tailored for various medical
   specialties, enabling the generation of various types of clinical notes, letters,
   discharge summaries, and your unique use case needs.
3. **Flexible Workflows**: Use pre-defined templates or cater to more dynamic workflows
   by selecting the desired, relevant sections.
4. **Template Management**: The API lets you retrieve and review a list of available
   pre-configured templates and the languages those are available in. Use the query filter
   for organization `?org` to only retrieve templates provided to you.

### Requesting a New Template

To request a new template, follow these steps:

1. **Visit** the [Corti Help Center](https://help.corti.ai).
2. **Use the Chat Feature** to contact our support team.
3. **Follow the Prompts** to request a new documentation template.
4. **Provide Details**: Include any specific formatting, language, or structural
   preferences required for the template.
5. Our team will process your request and provide updates on its status.

### Retrieving Available Templates

To generate a document such as a summary, you must use a valid `templateKey`
and the template must be available in the desired `outputLanguage`. 
To retrieve a list of available templates use the `GET /templates` reques
and use the ?lang= to filter for available languages. Without any language
filtering, the default returned are templates in `en`.

```javascript request to retrieve templates available in German
POST https://api.{environment}.corti.app/v2/templates?lang=de
```

### Using Templates to Generate Documents
Below sequence diagram refers to using the final facts list if your workflow
involves live notes. You can also use the final transcript as input context.

       Client->>Public API: POST /documents with final facts list and templateKey
       Public API-->>Client: Return document

       Client ->> optional: Public API: PATCH /interactions/{id} "completed"
       Public API -->> Client: 200, interaction
    ```

### Steps to Generate a Document

1. **Review and Finalize Data**: After the live session, the client can review
   and make final edits to the facts collected during the interaction. These
   finalized facts will be used to generate the document.
2. **Make a POST Request**: Send a `POST` request to the
   `/interactions/{id}/documents` endpoint with the finalized facts
   and the `templateKey` in the request payload. The templateKey defines the
   format of the output document.
3. **Process the Request**: The API processes the submitted data, applying the
   specified template to generate the structured document.
4. **Retrieve the Document**: If the request is successful, the API returns a
   `200 OK` status along with the formatted document.
5. **Optional: Mark Interaction as Completed**: If this marks the end of the encounter, the client
   can update the interaction status by sending a `PATCH` request to
   `/interactions/{id}`, setting the interaction state to
   `"completed"`.

---

Authentication to the API on all environments is governed by OAuth 2.0. This authentication protocol offers enhanced security measures, ensuring that access to patient data and medical documentation is securely managed and compliant with healthcare regulations.

<Info>By default, you will receive a client-id and client-secret to authenticate via grant type: client credentials. This can be modified and extended to authenticate individual users of your application, including options to utilize SSO or SAML.</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request an access token">
    To acquire an access token, make a request to the authURL provided to you.

    ```javascript auth URL
    https://keycloak.{environment}.corti.app/realms/{Tenant-Name}/protocol/openid-connect/token
    ```

    The full request body looks like this:

    ```jsx Client Credentials request body
    grant_type: "client_credentials"
    scope: "openid"
    client_id: "the-provided-client-id"
    client_secret: "********"
    ```

    <Tip>For the test environment `beta-eu`, the Tenant-Name is `copiloteu`.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your access token">
    It will return you an `access_token`

    ```jsx Access token
    {"access_token":"ey...","expires_in":300,"refresh_expires_in":0,"token_type":"Bearer","id_token":"e...","not-before-policy":0,"scope":"openid email profile"}
    ```

    As you can see, the access token expires after 300s/5min. By default as per oAuth standards, no refresh token is used in this flow. There are many available modules to manage monitoring expiry and acquiring a new access token. However, a refresh token can be enabled if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make an API request">
    Subsequently you use the access_token to authenticate any API request.

    ```javascript base URL API
    https://api.{environment}.corti.app/v2
    ```
    
    
    In your `Request Header` you also need to include the `Tenant-Name` parameter
    <Tip>For the test environment `beta-eu`, the Tenant-Name is `copiloteu`.</Tip>

    ```jsx API call request header
    Tenant-Name: <tenantname>
    Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
    ```
  </Step>

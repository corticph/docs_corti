---

Access to the Corti Co-Pilot API, particularly the development environment, is granted exclusively upon request to ensure that each integration meets the high standards of security and functionality required for medical applications. Interested customers are provided with a username and password after their request has been approved, which allows them to authenticate their applications and start integrating the API's capabilities.

Access to the API on all environments is governed by OAuth 2.0. This authentication protocol offers enhanced security measures, ensuring that access to patient data and medical documentation is securely managed and compliant with healthcare regulations.

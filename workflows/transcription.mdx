## Introduction 

The **Transcription Workflow** is defined by processing a complete audio file to return a text document. In scenarios where real-time speech-to-text is not required or feasible, the transcription workflow provides functional and cost effective means for creating verbatim, conversational or dictation-style transcripts. 


### Endpoints and capabilities 

| Endpoint | Capability | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Interactions | The foundational unit that ties together all related data and operations, enabling a cohesive workflow. | Required | 
| Recordings | Upload audio file(s) that can be used for transcript generation. | Required | 
| Transcripts | Generate transcripts for audio files that are associated with the interaction. | Required | 

## Workflow

        Client ->> Public API: POST /interactions
        Public API -->> Client: 200, interactionId, wssUrl
        Client ->> Public API: POST /interactions/:id/recording
        Public API -->> Client: 200, recordingId
        Client ->> Public API: POST /interactions/:id/transcripts
        Public API -->> Client: 200, transcript

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create interaction">
        1. The workflow begins with the client initiating an interaction by sending a `POST` request to the `/interactions` endpoint.
        2. The API responds with a unique `id` for the interaction and a WebSocket URL (`wssUrl`). The identifier will be used to manage the subsequent steps of the workflow. The WebSocket URL will not be required for this workflow. 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Upload audio recording">
        3. Once the interaction is initialized, the client uploads an audio file associated with that interaction by sending a `POST` request to `/interactions/:id/recording`.
        4. The API responds with a `200` status and returns a `recordingId`, confirming that the audio file has been successfully uploaded and linked to the interaction.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create transcript">
        5. After the recording is uploaded, the client initiates the transcription process by sending a `POST` request to `/interactions/:id/transcripts`.
        6. The API processes the audio and returns a `200` status with the generated transcript. This transcript contains the text version of the recorded interaction, extracted and formatted for review.
